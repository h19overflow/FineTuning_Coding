"""
Main orchestrator for the Gemma model training pipeline.
Coordinates components without containing business logic.

This file should:
1. Load training configuration from models/config.py
2. Initialize data loaders from components/data_loader.py
3. Set up model trainer from components/model_trainer.py
4. Execute training with monitoring hooks
5. Save trained model and metrics

Dependencies:
- data/training/ directory with Q&A training examples
- Unsloth or similar efficient training framework
- HuggingFace transformers for Gemma model loading
- Configurable training parameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs)

Expected workflow:
1. Validate training data format and quality
2. Load and preprocess training dataset
3. Initialize Gemma base model with LoRA/QLoRA adapters
4. Configure training parameters and optimization
5. Execute training with progress tracking
6. Save model checkpoints and final trained model
7. Generate training metrics and reports
