"""
Core model training infrastructure for Gemma fine-tuning.

This component should implement:
1. Gemma model initialization with LoRA/QLoRA adapters
2. Training loop with gradient accumulation
3. Loss computation and optimization
4. Checkpoint saving and loading
5. Training metrics collection

Key features to implement:
- Unsloth integration for efficient Gemma training
- LoRA/QLoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- Gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency
- Mixed precision training (fp16/bf16)
- Learning rate scheduling
- Early stopping based on validation metrics
- Distributed training support (if multiple GPUs)

Training optimizations:
- Flash Attention 2 for faster training
- Gradient accumulation for larger effective batch sizes
- Memory-efficient optimizers (AdamW 8-bit)
- Dynamic loss scaling for mixed precision

Dependencies:
- unsloth for efficient Gemma training
- transformers for model architecture
- torch for training infrastructure
- peft for LoRA adapters
