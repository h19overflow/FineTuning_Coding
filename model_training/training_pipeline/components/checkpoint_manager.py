"""
Checkpoint management for model training pipeline.

This component should handle:
1. Saving training checkpoints at regular intervals
2. Loading checkpoints for resuming training
3. Best model selection based on validation metrics
4. Checkpoint cleanup and storage optimization
5. Model export in different formats

Key responsibilities:
- Save model state, optimizer state, and training metadata
- Implement checkpoint rotation (keep only N best checkpoints)
- Support for resuming training from any checkpoint
- Export final model in HuggingFace format
- Save training configuration with each checkpoint
- Checkpoint validation and integrity checks

Features to include:
- Automatic checkpoint saving based on steps/epochs
- Manual checkpoint triggering
- Best model tracking based on validation loss/metrics
- Checkpoint compression for storage efficiency
- Metadata tracking (training time, hardware info, git commit)

Dependencies:
- torch for model state management
- transformers for model serialization
- File system utilities for checkpoint organization
