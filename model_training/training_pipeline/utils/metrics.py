Training metrics calculation and tracking utilities.

This utility should provide:
1. Training loss tracking and smoothing
2. Validation metrics computation
3. Learning curve generation
4. Performance benchmarking
5. Training progress visualization

Metrics to track:
- Training/validation loss over time
- Perplexity scores
- BLEU scores for code generation quality
- Training speed (tokens/second, steps/second)
- GPU utilization and memory usage
- Gradient norms and learning rate curves

Visualization features:
- Real-time training curves using matplotlib/wandb
- Loss smoothing and trend analysis
- Comparison charts for different training runs
- Hardware utilization dashboards

Export capabilities:
- Metrics to JSON/CSV for analysis
- Training reports with key statistics
- Integration with experiment tracking (wandb, tensorboard)

Dependencies:
- matplotlib for plotting
- pandas for metrics organization
- Optional: wandb for experiment tracking
