"""
Unified orchestrator for the complete model training and evaluation pipeline.

This orchestrator should coordinate:
1. Model training pipeline execution
2. Model evaluation and testing
3. Comparison analysis between different approaches
4. Monitoring and reporting integration
5. End-to-end pipeline management

Pipeline modes:
- TRAINING_ONLY: Execute only model training
- EVALUATION_ONLY: Evaluate existing trained model
- COMPARISON_ONLY: Run comparison analysis
- FULL_PIPELINE: Complete end-to-end execution

Key features:
- Configurable pipeline execution order
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Resource management and optimization
- Integration with monitoring services

Dependencies:
- All sub-pipeline main modules
- Configuration management system
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Resource management utilities

Expected workflow:
1. Load and validate pipeline configuration
2. Execute training pipeline (if enabled)
3. Run evaluation on trained model
4. Perform comparison analysis
5. Generate comprehensive reports
6. Clean up resources and finalize

This serves as the single entry point for the complete model development lifecycle.
