"""
Core model evaluation infrastructure for testing trained models.

This component should implement:
1. Model loading and initialization for testing
2. Batch inference processing for evaluation datasets
3. Performance metrics calculation
4. Quality assessment scoring
5. Automated testing pipeline execution

Evaluation capabilities:
- Load different model formats (HuggingFace, GGUF, etc.)
- Process evaluation datasets efficiently
- Calculate generation quality metrics
- Measure inference performance
- Generate detailed evaluation reports

Testing scenarios:
- Q&A accuracy on coding questions
- Code generation from natural language
- Documentation comprehension tests
- Edge case handling evaluation
- Consistency testing across similar inputs

Performance benchmarking:
- Tokens per second generation speed
- Memory usage during inference
- Model loading time
- Batch processing efficiency
- Hardware utilization metrics

Dependencies:
- transformers for model loading
- torch for inference processing
- Evaluation metric libraries
- Performance profiling tools
