"""
Benchmark execution and performance testing for model evaluation.

This component should handle:
1. Standardized benchmark execution
2. Performance profiling and measurement
3. Load testing and stress testing
4. Regression testing against baselines
5. Automated benchmark reporting

Benchmark types:
- Code generation benchmarks (HumanEval-style)
- Q&A accuracy benchmarks on documentation
- Performance benchmarks (latency, throughput)
- Memory efficiency benchmarks
- Scalability testing under load

Testing scenarios:
- Single request latency measurement
- Concurrent request handling
- Long-context processing capability
- Memory pressure testing
- GPU utilization optimization

Metrics collection:
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Throughput (requests/second, tokens/second)
- Resource utilization (CPU, GPU, memory)
- Error rates and failure modes
- Quality degradation under load

Dependencies:
- asyncio for concurrent testing
- psutil for system resource monitoring
- time/memory profiling utilities
- Statistical analysis libraries
