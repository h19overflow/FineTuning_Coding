"""
Main orchestrator for model testing and evaluation.

This service should:
1. Load trained models and test datasets
2. Execute comprehensive evaluation suites
3. Generate performance reports and metrics
4. Compare model performance across versions
5. Identify regression issues and quality problems

Testing capabilities:
- Automated model evaluation on held-out test sets
- Code generation quality assessment
- Response time and throughput benchmarking
- Memory usage profiling during inference
- Robustness testing with edge cases

Evaluation metrics:
- BLEU/ROUGE scores for code generation
- Exact match accuracy for factual questions
- Human-like response quality scoring
- Inference latency and throughput metrics
- Model size and deployment efficiency

Dependencies:
- Trained model loading utilities
- Evaluation dataset management
- Metrics calculation frameworks
- Report generation tools
