"""
Base Gemma model client without fine-tuning or external context.

This component should implement:
1. Pure base Gemma model loading and inference
2. Standard text generation without modifications
3. Consistent prompt formatting with other clients
4. Performance baseline measurement
5. Out-of-the-box capability assessment

Key responsibilities:
- Load unmodified Gemma model (same size as trained version)
- Apply identical prompt formatting as other clients
- Generate responses using only pre-training knowledge
- Measure baseline performance metrics
- Provide fair comparison baseline

Model configuration:
- Use same Gemma variant as training (2B/7B)
- No LoRA adapters or fine-tuning
- Standard generation parameters
- No external context or retrieval
- Pure language model capabilities

Comparison features:
- Identical interface to other model clients
- Consistent response formatting
- Performance metrics collection
- Knowledge gap identification
- Baseline quality assessment

This client serves as the control group to measure:
- Improvement from fine-tuning
- Value of RAG augmentation
- Knowledge acquisition through training
- Performance gains from specialization

Dependencies:
- transformers for base model loading
- torch for inference processing
- Standard Gemma tokenizer
- Performance monitoring utilities
