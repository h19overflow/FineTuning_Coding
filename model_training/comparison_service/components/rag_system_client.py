"""
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system client using base Gemma + chunk retrieval.

This component should implement:
1. Vector database setup with semantic chunks from data/chunks/
2. Query embedding and similarity search
3. Context retrieval and ranking
4. Base Gemma model integration with retrieved context
5. Response generation with source attribution

RAG pipeline:
- Embed user query using same embeddings as chunk creation
- Search vector database for relevant semantic chunks
- Rank and select top-k most relevant chunks
- Format retrieved context into prompt for base Gemma
- Generate response using base model + context
- Include source attribution in response

Vector database features:
- Load semantic chunks from data/chunks/ JSON files
- Use same Nomic embeddings for consistency
- Implement efficient similarity search (FAISS/Chroma)
- Support configurable retrieval parameters (top-k, threshold)
- Context ranking and relevance scoring

Context integration:
- Intelligent context formatting for Gemma
- Context length management and truncation
- Multiple chunk fusion and summarization
- Source tracking and attribution

Dependencies:
- Vector database (FAISS, Chroma, or similar)
- Embedding model (same as chunk creation)
- Base Gemma model for generation
- Chunk loading and processing utilities
