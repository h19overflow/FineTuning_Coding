"""
Client interface for the trained Gemma model.

This component should implement:
1. Trained model loading and initialization
2. Inference request handling
3. Response formatting and post-processing
4. Performance metrics collection
5. Error handling and fallback mechanisms

Key responsibilities:
- Load fine-tuned Gemma model with LoRA adapters
- Handle tokenization and text generation
- Apply consistent prompt formatting
- Measure inference time and resource usage
- Implement response caching if needed

Model capabilities:
- Direct question answering without external context
- Code generation from natural language descriptions
- Technical explanation and documentation
- Consistent response formatting
- Configurable generation parameters

Performance optimizations:
- Model quantization for faster inference
- Batch processing for multiple queries
- Memory management for long conversations
- GPU utilization optimization

Dependencies:
- transformers for model loading
- torch for inference processing
- Model checkpoint management
- Performance monitoring utilities
