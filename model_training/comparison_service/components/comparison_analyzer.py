"""
Comparative analysis engine for evaluating different model approaches.

This component should implement:
1. Multi-model response collection and organization
2. Quality scoring and comparative metrics
3. Performance analysis across different dimensions
4. Statistical significance testing
5. Comprehensive comparison reporting

Analysis capabilities:
- Side-by-side response comparison
- Quality scoring using multiple metrics
- Response time and resource usage analysis
- Accuracy assessment for factual content
- User preference simulation and scoring

Comparison dimensions:
- Response accuracy and correctness
- Code quality and functionality
- Explanation clarity and completeness
- Response time and efficiency
- Resource utilization (memory, compute)
- Consistency across similar queries

Scoring frameworks:
- BLEU/ROUGE for response similarity
- Code compilation and execution testing
- Factual accuracy verification
- Human-like quality assessment
- Technical correctness evaluation

Statistical analysis:
- Significance testing for performance differences
- Confidence intervals for quality metrics
- Distribution analysis of response scores
- Correlation analysis between metrics
- Trend analysis across query types

Report generation:
- Executive summary with key findings
- Detailed metric breakdowns
- Visual comparisons and charts
- Recommendations for use cases
- ROI analysis for different approaches

Dependencies:
- Statistical analysis libraries
- Evaluation metric implementations
- Visualization tools
- Report generation utilities
