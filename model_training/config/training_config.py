"""
Comprehensive training configuration for model fine-tuning.

This configuration should include:
1. Model architecture settings (Gemma variant, size)
2. Training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs)
3. Optimization settings (optimizer, scheduler, gradient clipping)
4. LoRA/QLoRA adapter configuration
5. Hardware and performance settings

Model configuration:
